The program works as intended. I used c++ version 11.
 
-To compile type in the command line: 
$g++ -std=c++11 proj4.cpp -o proj4
NOTE: It needs to be compiled with the verision 11 or newer. After compiling, 
the user may get some messages about not being able to initizale some variables.
That is normal since the size of the frame is dynamically allocated as described
in the description of the project. 

-After compiling using c++11, to run the program type in the command line:
$./proj4

The program will ask user to input the size of the frame. The program always creates
20 reference strings with the values between 1 to 5, as stated in the descrption.

Thanks for your time,
